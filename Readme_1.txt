Problem statement:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Solution:
There would be to step solve this problem:
1.Iterates through all number and check whether they are multiple of 3 or 5, and if it is then add the number or
leave it.

2.Use Join formula of Union:
i.e

sum of multiple of 3 and 5 = sum of multiple of 3 + sum of multiple of 5 - sum of multiple of 15


Note :if any body knows better solution, please provide it.
